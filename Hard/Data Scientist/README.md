# Data Scientist

## Problem

My friend is a data-scientist and he spends his days using Excel or cool python libraries like numpy, pandas, or opencv. But this morning he was feeling grumpy and hid my flag in a CSV.

The only thing he told me is that the real hint will be given when you find what the columns mean.

## Hints
- Find Mean of Each Column
- Round All Mean Values
- And U will get Hint
    ```
    SET ALL VALUES BETWEEN 64 AND 65 TO BLACK AND SCAN IT
    ```
- After changes all values according to the hint, we will get QRCode
- Scan it and get the flag
